<h3>General biology and habitat</h3>

<p>
    Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds,
    insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[26] or young mice.[27]
    The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[28] The world's oldest known
    chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[29]
