*   EM are relative units:

        1. Font size:    
            --> 1em equals the font-size of the parent
            --> 2em's is twice the font-size of the parent

        2. With other properies 1em is equal to the computed font-size of the element itself

*   ROOT EMS (rems):

        1. relative to the root html element's font-size

        2. if the root font-size is 20px: 
            --> 1 rem is always 20px
            --> 2 rem is always 40px

        3. root element always stays the same
