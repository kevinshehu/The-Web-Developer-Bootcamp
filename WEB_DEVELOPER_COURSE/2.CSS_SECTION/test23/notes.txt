1-  Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.

2-  Flexbox is a recent addition to CSS, included to adress common layout frustrations.

3-  Flexbox allows us to distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size.

*   Example (flex):

        flex-direction: row;            --> show all the elements in a row from left to right
        flex-direction: row-reverse;    --> show all the elements in a row from right to left

        flex-direction: column;         --> show all the elements in a columnt from top to bottom

*   Example (justify-content):

        justify-content: flex-start;    --> start from the beggining
        justify-content: flex-end;      --> push to the end
        justify-content: space-between; --> space between elements but not space between elements and container
        justify-content: space-evenly;  --> sapce is evenly shared

*   Example (wrap):

        1. flex-wrap: wrap;
        2. flex-wrap: nowrap;
        3. flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;

*   Align Items to center:

        /*justify*/
        justify-content: center;

        /*start from the bottom*/
        align-items: center;
