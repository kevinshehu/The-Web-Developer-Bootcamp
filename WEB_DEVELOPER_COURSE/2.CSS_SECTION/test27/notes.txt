*   RESPONSIVE DESIGN*

1.  How do we create websites that look good on all screen siezes?

    -   These days, we typically create ONE website and stylesheet 
        that is able to respond to different device seizes and features.

2.  MEDIA QUERIES:

    -   They allow us to modify our styles depending on 
        particular parameters like screen width or device type.
